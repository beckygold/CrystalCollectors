# Crystal Collectors
A web game where the player must add up crystals in order to match the random number generated at the beginning of the game. Each crystal has a randomly assigned hidden value ranging from 1-12. If the player goes past the random number when adding their crystals, they lose. 
This app utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery and was built with the Bootstrap CSS framework. Crystal images were created by me.
